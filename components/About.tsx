                For my father, selling vegetables isn't just a businessâ€”it's a tradition. He started helping at his family's market stall as a child, learning the art of picking the freshest produce from the bustling wholesale markets long before sunrise.
              </p>

                Today, he continues that legacy at the local Sandhai, where he's a trusted face for countless families. Butterscotch Sellers is our way of sharing that lifelong passion, bringing the freshest, hand-selected vegetables from the market directly to your home, whether you're in Pollachi or planning a large celebration elsewhere in India.
